          <p><img class="alignleft img-responsive" src="img/rosana.jpg" alt="Rosana Pina" width="400">Hello there! My name is Rosana Pina and I have previously studied for a Design Degree at the University of Lisbon, Faculty of Architecture. Along with a Master’s Degree in Communication Design studied at the same institution. During my time of study I had developed project skills in product design and as well as learning about the graphic side of this discipline. I have gained some professional experience as a freelancer collaborating with multiple organizations by generating and contributing to their visual identities and promotional materials.</p>
          <p>My last and relevant experiences were acquired performing the function as intern designer in national and international agencies such as Havas Worldwide Portugal, as Creative Director in Ivan Pinheiro & Associados and as a Graphic Designer at Webfold.</p>
          <p>Over this duration I have increased my agility and performance throughout the  concept and execution of different projects (editorial, digital, packaging, among others), improved my communication in direct contact with clients, broaden my insight in the preparation of consistent graphical languages also thinking and being cohesive with the background and philosophy of each brand being transmitted to the public. Finally, my experience guaranteed I am able meet the expectations and demands of a competitive market. I consider myself a positive and creative individual who is great at collaborating with others to create effective design solutions, as well as taking full responsibility of working individually in a effective manner. Fully committed completing rigorous and remarkable works helping your company grow and be unforgetable.</p>
          <p>Ever since design has been a passion, I haven’t stopped working to achieve more as I travelled to another country to learn more.</p>
          <p>Over the past few years I have been involved in activities such as music (gospel choir and philharmonic band where I play clarinet), yoga, graphic design volunteering and entrepreneur groups. My hobbies and professional experience have also helped me develop organizational and communication skills effectively. Overall, I’m genuinely excited about what is to come with progressing myself in a career of design.</p>

She took great interest in all aspects of the business and learnt new skills very quickly.”</p>

Often assumed a strong leadership role within group, frequently putting others first and developing a good report with other participants.
